## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Great styling! Looks fresh and organized with a nice color scheme.
* No attitudes and behaviors section in the persona.
* Could use a some more detail and elaboration throughout, but necessary info is there besides the above.
* Try to commit more often, a good rule of thumb is every 15 minutes or 15 lines of code.
* Clean code, no errors when run through the W3C Validation Service, nice!

Overall good work, you seem to have an eye for design and write clean code. Try to spend a little more time on the content and commit more frequently. Nice work.

**Grade: Tier III**


### Milestone 2
Excellent job on your PWP Milestone2. I love the styling you used what was that color of grey you used for the background?
Your content strategy is clear and gives a clear explanation of what you hope to accomplish. I love the amount of detail you went into with the wireframes, and you did a perfect job implementing the Z pattern.
* Have you given any thought on how you plan on displaying the lessons you want to demo?
  * I  recommend trying to use flat Javascript as much as possible. (Kind of like the color picker from prework)
* For the no rectangular headers checkout [Css-Tricks non-rectangular headers](https://css-tricks.com/creating-non-rectangular-headers/) and [some weird demo I found](https://frontfolks.com/code/non-rectangular-header-with-parallax-effect-using-bootstrap-4/)
