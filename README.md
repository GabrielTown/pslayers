## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Great styling! Looks fresh and organized with a nice color scheme.
* No attitudes and behaviors section in the persona.
* Could use a some more detail and elaboration throughout, but necessary info is there besides the above.
* Try to commit more often, a good rule of thumb is every 15 minutes or 15 lines of code.
* Clean code, no errors when run through the W3C Validation Service, nice!

Overall good work, you seem to have an eye for design and write clean code. Try to spend a little more time on the content and commit more frequently. Nice work.
