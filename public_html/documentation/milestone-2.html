	<h1>Gabriel Town</h1>
	<h2>PWP Milestone Two</h2>
	<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
	<p>My site will be one page and consist of the following sections:</p>
	<p><strong>Purpose: </strong> A brief statement explaining the purpose of the website.
		I haven't decided if I will add an image and what that would be.</p>
	<p><strong>Opacity: </strong> This will consist of a small description of opacity. To the left
	or right of the description will be a slider that has percentages from 0 - 100% and a picture where
		you will see the effects of opacity.</p>
	<p><strong>Blending Mode: </strong> Again, a small description of what blending mode does and then
		three buttons or menu that shows three options and a picture that changes with each option.</p>
	<p><strong>Masks: </strong> A small description of masks, a picture to edit, and a two boxes (white and black)
		to the side of the picture. This section you can erase part of the picture if you have black selected and
		bring part of it back if you have white selected. </p>
	<p><strong>Extra (3d Layers): </strong> If I have time, this section will show layers of a final project in 3d.</p>
	<p><strong>Contact: </strong> This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and
		additional links LinkedIn, GitHub, and my portfolio website.
